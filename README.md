Following are the things which I have done in this project
1. Fetched data from "remoteok" website.
2. First of all I have fetched "Url and location" of 50 jobs from main screen.
3. Then I visited every single link one by one and fetched other details like title, company name, job description.
4. Salary column is left null beacuse the website gives salary to preminium users.
5. I made a loop to fetch every url and location using css selectors.
6. Then I used that loop to visit every page and got data using css selectors.
7. I also made a jason for better understandig of data along with csv.
